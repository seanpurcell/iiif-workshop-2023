## A IIIF Viewer
 
A IIIF viewer is a React component that takes a single property, `iiifContent`, which is the URI to the
IIIF manifest. The component will then fetch the Manifest and render a deep-zoom viewer. The viewer is
responsive and will resize to fit the container it is placed in.
 
<Viewer iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/14a6aa15-9e12-47a7-9617-91f430d4f47b?as=iiif" />
